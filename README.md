# Simple_calculator_java
This Java project implements a simple console-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform the desired operation. The program utilizes a `switch` statement to handle the different operations based on the user's input. Additionally, it includes error handling for division by zero, ensuring that the user is notified when an invalid operation is attempted. If the user inputs an unsupported operator, the program displays an error message, making it user-friendly and reliable for basic calculations.
